          <h5 className="">I am a creator</h5>
          <p className="">
            I consider myself a life-long creator and a veteran in web development
            (though one who is constantly learning and improving).
          </p>
          <p>
            My philosophy in design has always been to challenge myself and invent
            new and ambitious ways of developing content. In web development in
            particular, I pride myself in avoiding prefabs and third-party
            libraries in my own personal work; if it's something I can learn to do
            myself, that's what I'm going to do.
          </p>
          <p>
            That isn't to say I don't have experience with libraries, though! I
            often work with the more essential Javascript libraries, including
            jQuery and React.js
          </p>
          <h5 className="">I am a programmer</h5>
          <p>
            My experience as a programmer began at an early age, when I would
            explore the inner workings of DOS and write small games using chains
            of batch scripts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since then, I have expanded on and improved my skills and abilities on
            my own as a self-taught coder with experience in languages including
            HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, Python, and C.
          </p>
          <h5 className="">I am an artist</h5>
          <p>
            On the design side of web development, as the son of an art teacher, I
            had always possessed a certain ability for visual arts and layout.
            Throughout my life I have constantly worked to improve my aptitude in
            digital graphics and animation, as well as my instincts in colours and
            form. With a formal education in print design and layout, I've used my
            collection of abilities to always come up with new and interesting
            ways of developing exciting web sites and applications.
