          <h5>Hey there!</h5>
          <p>
            I'm a multi-skilled front-end developer and writer based in Toronto,
            Canada.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm always refining my skills as a creator and as both a front-end and
            back-end developer. Below you can see just a small glimpse of the work
            I've done as a front-end developer, applying my past skills in print
            design, graphic design, animation, writing, and photography!
          </p>
          <h5 className="">What's your story?</h5>
          <p className="">
            Born and raised in Niagara Falls, I eventually found myself in love with
            the city of Toronto, studying at prestigious schools including <a href="http://utoronto.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> University of Toronto</a>, <a href="http://humber.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humber College</a>, and <a href="https://junocollege.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juno</a> (formerly <a href="https://hackeryou.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HackerYou</a>).
          </p>
          <p>
            I have years of experience freelancing as a web developer for small
            businesses and non-profits, as well as a copy editor and writer, trading
            largely with local publications.
          </p>
          <h5 className="">Okay, but what else?</h5>
          <p>
            Having graduated from Juno's immersive front-end development program, I
            have become a highly-skilled and dedicated front-end developer, with a
            deeply-rooted love for what I do.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have an indomitable passion for giving back to the LGBTQ+ community,
            of which I owe so much, and love working with people and working toward
            making the world a better place through both charity foundations and
            advocacy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of all, I am dedicated to growing as a person and becoming better
            every day, however I can. I have a genuine love of all people and will
            always go out of my way to provide whatever support I can for those in
            need.
          </p>
          <h6 className="">(Also I'm pretty good at Dark Souls)</h6>
